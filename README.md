These are some of the JVMTI tools that I have built for debugging/exploring/testing various JVM issues. Currently there is only the `jnistack_agent` that prints the name and the stack trace of the threads calling `GetPrimitiveArrayCritical`, `ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical` that acquires/releases the GCLocker (which may be a source of various GC-related issues, see  Shipil—ëv's [blog post](https://shipilev.net/jvm-anatomy-park/9-jni-critical-gclocker/)).
